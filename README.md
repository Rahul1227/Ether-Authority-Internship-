# Web3 + React Foundations – Week 1

This repository contains my **Week 1 work** for the Web3 + React Foundations program.  
It covers **Solidity smart contracts** and **core React concepts** through hands-on examples.

The goal of this week was to build a strong foundation by **implementing basics properly**, not just reading theory.

## 📌 Week 1 – Foundations

### Topics Covered
- Blockchain fundamentals & Ethereum basics  
- Solidity syntax and smart contract deployment  
- React.js fundamentals (components, props, state)  
- AI fundamentals and real-world use cases (documentation only)  
- Development environment setup  

---

## 🛠 Development Environment
- Node.js & npm  
- VS Code  
- Remix IDE  
- MetaMask Wallet  
- Sepolia Test Network

## 🔐 Solidity Smart Contracts

All contracts were written and deployed using **Remix IDE** on the **Sepolia test network**.

### Implemented Contracts
- HelloWorld Contract  
- Counter Contract  
- Simple Storage Contract  
- Ownable Pattern  
- Ether Transfer Smart Contract  
- Ethereum Account & Ownership Example  
- Student Registration Contract  
- Simple Voting Contract  
- Internship Task Status Storage Contract  

> These contracts helped me understand state variables, functions, modifiers, ownership, and deployment flow.

## ⚛️ React Application

A basic React application was built to practice **core React concepts**.  
The app uses:
- React Router for navigation  
- Functional components  
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)  
- Vanilla CSS (no UI libraries)

### React Examples Implemented
- **Counter App**
  - Increase & decrease counter
  - Proper state handling and UI updates  

- **Input Form App**
  - Input validation
  - Submit button
  - Error handling
  - Display submitted data  

- **Todo List App**
  - Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed
  - Clean UI and functional logic  

- **Simple API Fetch Example**
  - User-provided API URL
  - Loading state
  - Error handling
  - Display fetched data  

- **Component Reuse Example**
  - Reusable card component
  - Props usage for dynamic content

## 📁 Project Structure
``` text

```

The structure is kept **modular and readable**, making it easy to extend in future weeks.

## 🚀 How to Run the React App

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
